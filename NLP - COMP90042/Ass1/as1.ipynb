    "<b>Due date</b>: Monday, 27 March 2023 1pm\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission method</b>: Canvas submission\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission materials</b>: completed copy of this iPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -10% per day (both week and weekend days counted)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 9% of mark for class (with 8% on correctness + 1% on quality and efficiency of your code)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See \"Using Jupyter Notebook and Python\" page on Canvas (under Modules>Resources) for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Gensim, Keras and Pytorch. We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3.8</b>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To familiarize yourself with NLTK, here is a free online book:  Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper (2009). <a href=https://www.nltk.org/book/>Natural Language Processing with Python</a>. O'Reilly Media Inc. You may also consult the <a href=https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html>NLTK API</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each question is worth is explicitly given. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via Canvas. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced on the discussion board; we recommend you check it regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place. In regards to the use of artificial intelligence tools in the context of academic integrity, please see the university's statement <a href=\"https://academicintegrity.unimelb.edu.au/plagiarism-and-collusion/artificial-intelligence-tools-and-technologies\">here</a>."
